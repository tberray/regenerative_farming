                Nitrate (NO3) serves as a source of nitrogen for the nutrition and growth of plants and microorganisms.
                 In general, a concentration range of 10—50 mg/kg is good.

                Soil pH is the measure of acidity and the basicity of soil.
                 It affects plant nutrient availability by controlling the chemical forms of the different nutrients
                  and influencing the chemical reactions they undergo. The optimal range is between 5.5 to 7.5 for most plants.

                Earthworms occur in most temperate soils and many tropical soils.
                 There are over 7,000 species ranging from an inch to two yards in length and
                  are found seasonally at all depths in the soil.
                   They stimulate microbial activity, mix and aggregate soil,
                    increase infiltration, improve water-holding capacity, and more.
                     Earthworms are often an indication of healthy soil.

        <div class="terms-info mx-auto">
            <p>
                Soil enzymes increase the reaction rate at which plant residues decompose and release
                 plant-available nutrients. Sources of soil enzymes include living and dead microbes,
                  plant roots and residues, and soil animals. Enzymes play an important role in

            <p>
                Carbon dioxide released from the soil surface is referred to as soil respiration.
                 CO2 results from several sources, including aerobic microbial decomposition of soil organic matter.
                  Soil respiration is one measure of biological activity and decomposition.
                   Soil respiration reflects the capacity of soil to support soil life including crops,
